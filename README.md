## Description of the Project
This application is my personal portfolio. Potential employers can view my current my application. To contact me, potential employers can go to my contact page enter their full name, valid email, and a message. I will be retrieve when they hit submit through a post. (Grader, this portion is not yet setup.) 
This application uses Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, React, and Express to run the application. This application requires you to understand package.json and its node_modules. In addition to that, gitignore file is important to use so certain folders and files are not upload to GitHub. For example, node_modules should not be uploaded to GitHub since this folder gets created during the installation process. Lastly, this project stands out since the application has its own client-side server.

## Installation
To create this project, follow these several steps. This application is a MERN stack application (Mongoose (version 6.7.1), Express (version 4.18.1), React (version 18.2.0), and Node.js). Step one, download Node.js. Next go to the terminal of the index.js and type this command ```npm install```. This creates package.json file and its dependencies. 


## Usage
To use this application, open the terminal, respective to the file. Run the application type ```npm start``` .

This is what my Portfolio looks like.
